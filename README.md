### Bonus ‚≠ê

This portfolio template contain a Spotify Card component [here](./components/Misc/Spotify.card.tsx) which shows the current streaming song on spotify.

**Example:**

To configure this, you need to add `env` vars to thr `.env.local` file in the following format:


```txt
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id_here>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_client_secret_here>
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=<your_refresh_token_here>
```

Read this [article](https://leerob.io/blog/spotify-api-nextjs) to get our own keys in this format.

And you're good to go!
